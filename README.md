# Red Robins Textbook Exchange
We know textbooks are expensive and many of them end up sitting on the shelf collecting dust at the end of
the semester.  The Red Robins Textbook Exchange offers a trustworthy marketplace of UVA students to both buy and sell 
old textbooks. It's simple, just create a profile with a google account, list the textbook with some 
identifying information and wait to be contacted by potential buyers.
If you're in the market for old textbooks, Textbook Exchange is also the place for you.  Use the search bar to find the textbook and contact the seller effortlessly through the website.
You can also search for textbooks by class!
